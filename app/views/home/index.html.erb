           <p>Life is meant to be shared! God designed us to experience life together—rejoicing 
           	with each other in successes and standing with each other through hard times.   
           	God has placed within each of us an urge to love others.  
           	A Life Group is a place to do that.  We need each other! </p>

          <h2>Gatherings</h2>
          <p>As we’ve met and grown together throughout the week, it’s good to get together for a 
          	big celebration and worship time.  Our praise gatherings are meant to lift up God, learn from God, 
          	inspire each other, and celebrate all that the Lord has done in our lives.  <br/>
          	Expect the worship in song to be dynamic, relevant, and passionate. Expect the message to be simple, fresh, 
			and profound.  Our prayer is that you walk away filled with life and expectation.  We also hope you’ve  
			gotten to know some new friends. </p>
